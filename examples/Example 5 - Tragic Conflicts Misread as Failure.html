			<h1><strong>PMS–ANTICIPATION</strong></h1>
			<h2><em>Example 5: Tragic Conflicts Misread as &quot;Failure&quot;</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<h2>0) Identity &amp; Purpose</h2>
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>Tragedy → Blame Spiral Miscode</em>
			<strong>Purpose:</strong> Show how <strong>structurally tragic conflicts</strong> (no clean outcome possible) are routinely <strong>re-coded as avoidable failure</strong>, producing blame hunting, responsibility escalation, and moral polarization.
			<strong>Scope:</strong> Praxeological configurations (frames, roles, escalation dynamics) — <strong>not</strong> judgments of persons, diagnoses, or “who is guilty.”
			<strong>Core PMS strength used here:</strong> PMS makes tragedy structurally visible: <strong>Λ (Non-Event)</strong> is irreducible, <strong>Θ (Temporality)</strong> makes every exit painful, <strong>Ω (Asymmetry)</strong> distributes suffering inevitably, and <strong>Χ (Distance)</strong> must be held to prevent moralization.
			<strong>PMS entry condition reminder:</strong> Valid application presupposes <strong>Χ (Distance)</strong>, <strong>reversibility</strong>, and <strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice)</strong>. Tragic scenes tempt analysts to suspend these (“we need clarity / a culprit / a decisive fix”).</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>1) Scenario (Scenic Setup)</h2>
			<p>A high-stakes situation arises where <strong>every option harms something</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>A hospital triage shortage: saving one patient means not saving another.</li>
			<li>A wartime evacuation: leaving now abandons some; staying risks all.</li>
			<li>A corporate insolvency: layoffs or collapse; either damages lives.</li>
			<li>A family care crisis: one caregiver cannot meet all needs without breaking.</li>
			<li>A public policy dilemma: protecting one vulnerable group increases burdens on another.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The environment demands decisions under constraints, uncertainty, and time. After an outcome, observers often insist:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>“There must have been a correct solution.”</li>
			<li>“If they were competent/moral, no one would have suffered.”</li>
			<li>“Someone must be responsible for the pain.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed shift:</strong>
			Tragedy is treated as <strong>avoidable</strong>, and pain becomes evidence of <strong>culpable failure</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>2) Frame Validity Check — <strong>□ (Frame)</strong></h2>
			<h3>2.1 What is the frame?</h3>
			<p>Tragic conflicts typically contain <strong>competing frames</strong> that cannot be perfectly integrated in real time:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>care frame:</strong> “minimize harm to persons”</li>
			<li><strong>rule frame:</strong> “follow policy, fairness, legality”</li>
			<li><strong>outcome frame:</strong> “maximize overall survival/benefit”</li>
			<li><strong>accountability frame:</strong> “someone must answer for consequences”</li>
			<li><strong>identity/moral frame:</strong> “a good agent would not allow this”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In tragedy, these frames are <strong>incompatibly demanding</strong> under actual constraints.</p>
			<h3>2.2 Frame failure signal</h3>
			<p>A tragedy becomes “failure” when a frame is treated as <strong>total</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Outcome frame totalized → “if harm occurred, calculation failed.”</li>
			<li>Rule frame totalized → “if harm occurred, compliance failed.”</li>
			<li>Moral frame totalized → “if harm occurred, character failed.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>PMS-critical: Tragedy requires <strong>frame plurality</strong> without totalization.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>3) Non-Event Integrity — <strong>Λ (Non-Event)</strong></h2>
			<h3>3.1 “Λ is irreducible” (your point)</h3>
			<p>In tragic scenes, Λ is not a missing detail to fix; it is structural:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>the “perfect option” does not exist</li>
			<li>the “clean rescue” does not occur</li>
			<li>the “harm-free resolution” remains absent</li>
			<li>the “full knowledge” never arrives in time</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This absence is not a mistake; it is the scene’s <strong>operator reality</strong>.</p>
			<h3>3.2 The common corruption: Λ-denial</h3>
			<p>Observers (or participants) recode Λ as if it were reducible:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>“If you had planned better, the clean option would be there.”</li>
			<li>“If you were moral enough, you’d find the harm-free path.”</li>
			<li>“If you were competent, nobody would suffer.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural mutation:</strong>
			Λ (structured absence) becomes <strong>Λ→Δ’</strong> (reframed as mere ignorance/neglect), inviting blame.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>4) Temporality &amp; Irreversibility — <strong>Θ (Temporality)</strong></h2>
			<h3>4.1 “Θ makes every exit painful” (your point)</h3>
			<p>Tragedy is defined by <strong>irreversible trade-offs</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>decisions lock trajectories</li>
			<li>windows close</li>
			<li>costs accumulate</li>
			<li>regret is structurally guaranteed</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Even “best-available” choices under Θ generate future pain.</p>
			<h3>4.2 Θ misread as evidence of wrongdoing</h3>
			<p>Because Θ produces durable consequences, people infer:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>“the durability of harm proves a preventable error.”</li>
			<li>“if it hurts later, it was wrong then.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>PMS correction: Θ makes pain <strong>expected</strong>, not necessarily indicting.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>5) Asymmetry Audit — <strong>Ω (Asymmetry)</strong></h2>
			<h3>5.1 “Ω distributes suffering inevitably” (your point)</h3>
			<p>In tragedy, Ω is unavoidable:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>some carry exposure</li>
			<li>some carry authority</li>
			<li>some carry consequences without agency</li>
			<li>some can decide, others can only endure</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Tragic Ω means suffering cannot be distributed “fairly” in a way that leaves nobody harmed.</p>
			<h3>5.2 Ω corruption: Responsibility escalation</h3>
			<p>Observers often treat Ω as moral entitlement to blame:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>“You had capacity → therefore you owe a harm-free outcome.”</li>
			<li>“If you had power → you must absorb all pain.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural error:</strong> Capacity under Ω is turned into omnipotence claims, which guarantees disappointment and blame.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>6) Distance Enforcement — <strong>Χ (Distance)</strong></h2>
			<h3>6.1 “Χ must be held to avoid moralizing tragedy” (your point)</h3>
			<p>In tragic scenes, Χ is the operator that prevents the slide from:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>pain</strong> → <strong>culpability</strong></li>
			<li><strong>constraint</strong> → <strong>excuse-making accusations</strong></li>
			<li><strong>trade-off</strong> → <strong>moral condemnation</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Χ holds the distinction between:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>“harm occurred” and “harm was chosen maliciously/culpably”</li>
			<li>“decision under constraint” and “negligence”</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>6.2 Typical Χ failure</h3>
			<p>After suffering, communities drop Χ to force clarity:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>“We need accountability now.”</li>
			<li>“Stop rationalizing.”</li>
			<li>“Naming trade-offs is immoral.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>That move <strong>collapses distance</strong>, enabling blame spirals.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>7) Recontextualization — <strong>Φ (Reframing)</strong></h2>
			<h3>7.1 Φ in healthy tragedy handling</h3>
			<p>Φ allows: “Given constraints, we reinterpret what ‘success’ means.”</p>
			<ul>
			<li>success = best-available harm reduction</li>
			<li>success = dignity preserved under loss</li>
			<li>success = learning without retroactive guilt</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>7.2 Φ in blame spirals</h3>
			<p>Φ gets weaponized into hindsight moralization:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>“Now that we know the outcome, the earlier choice was clearly wrong.”</li>
			<li>“If you truly cared, you would have foreseen this.”</li>
			<li>“This suffering proves you failed.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Structural mutation:</strong> Φ becomes an <strong>after-the-fact certainty machine</strong>, closing Λ retroactively.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>8) Integration — <strong>Σ (Integration)</strong></h2>
			<h3>8.1 What Σ must integrate in tragedy</h3>
			<p>Σ has a brutal job here: integrate incompatible goods under Θ and Ω:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>partial responsibilities</li>
			<li>conflicting values</li>
			<li>unavoidable remainder harm</li>
			<li>limits of capacity</li>
			<li>emotional reality without moral inflation</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>8.2 Σ failure pattern: “single-axis verdict”</h3>
			<p>Instead of integration, the system produces one dominant verdict:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>“someone failed”</li>
			<li>“someone is guilty”</li>
			<li>“this should have been avoidable”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>That is coherence (C) masquerading as integration (Σ).</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>9) Self-Binding — <strong>Ψ (Self-Binding)</strong></h2>
			<h3>9.1 Ψ in mature tragedy handling</h3>
			<p>Ψ binds agents (and institutions) to:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>criteria of restraint (Χ)</li>
			<li>owning consequences without claiming omnipotence</li>
			<li>maintaining dignity under Ω</li>
			<li>revisability and learning under Φ</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>9.2 Ψ corruption: scapegoat-binding</h3>
			<p>When tragedy is coded as failure, Ψ is externalized into punitive bonding:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>“someone must carry the shame”</li>
			<li>“someone must pay so we can restore moral order”</li>
			<li>“the system needs a culprit to feel coherent”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is <strong>Ψ displaced</strong>: instead of self-binding to responsibility under tragedy, the community binds itself to blame.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>10) The Anticipable Misdevelopment</h2>
			<blockquote>
			<p><strong>Tragedy is re-coded as “avoidable” → blame spirals.</strong></p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3>10.1 Operator description of the tipping point</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Λ denied</strong> (“there was a harm-free option”)</li>
			<li><strong>Θ moralized</strong> (“if time mattered, you should have been perfect earlier”)</li>
			<li><strong>Ω inflated</strong> (“capacity implies total responsibility”)</li>
			<li><strong>Χ dropped</strong> (“distance is excuse”)</li>
			<li><strong>Φ weaponized</strong> (hindsight becomes certainty)</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ displaced</strong> (social cohesion built via scapegoat)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At this point the scene no longer tolerates tragic remainder; it demands purification through guilt.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>11) Derived Axes Projection (A, C, R, E, D)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>A (Awareness):</strong> high (many signals, harms, stakeholders visible)</li>
			<li><strong>C (Coherence):</strong> often becomes <em>too</em> high via a single blame narrative</li>
			<li><strong>R (Responsibility):</strong> inflates into <strong>over-attribution</strong> (capacity → omnipotence)</li>
			<li><strong>E (Action):</strong> can become compulsive (punishment, policy overcorrection, symbolic action)</li>
			<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice):</strong> the core casualty if blame spirals dehumanize decision-makers, victims, or dissenters</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Signature:</strong>
			High A + high C + escalating R + pressured E, while <strong>Χ collapses</strong> and <strong>D is sacrificed</strong> to restore moral certainty.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>12) Failure Mechanism — Why People Prefer “Failure” Over Tragedy</h2>
			<h3>12.1 Structural reason</h3>
			<p>Tragedy threatens moral order because it implies:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>suffering can occur without villainy</li>
			<li>goodness cannot guarantee clean outcomes</li>
			<li>responsibility does not equal control</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So the system seeks closure by converting tragedy into a solvable error:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Λ (irreducible absence)</strong> is replaced by <strong>certainty of avoidability</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Θ (irreversibility)</strong> is reframed as “proof of mistake”</li>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is treated as entitlement to accuse</li>
			<li><strong>Χ</strong> is discarded because it prevents quick closure</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>12.2 The attractor effect — <strong>Α (Attractor)</strong></h3>
			<p>Once blame “works” socially (it unifies, it simplifies, it mobilizes), it stabilizes:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>repeated scapegoating becomes the default response to tragedy</li>
			<li>complexity is punished</li>
			<li>restraint is read as moral weakness</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Α then locks the community into recurring blame spirals across future tragic events.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>13) Viability Criteria (Non-Prognostic)</h2>
			<p>A PMS-valid handling of tragedy is viable if it preserves:</p>
			<ol>
			<li><strong>Λ integrity:</strong> acknowledge irreducible remainder harm</li>
			<li><strong>Θ realism:</strong> accept that time creates unavoidable loss and regret</li>
			<li><strong>Ω clarity:</strong> distinguish capacity gradients from omnipotence claims</li>
			<li><strong>Χ continuity:</strong> keep distance active especially under outrage</li>
			<li><strong>Φ discipline:</strong> prevent hindsight from becoming retroactive certainty</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ proper location:</strong> bind agents/institutions to learning and restraint, not to scapegoating</li>
			<li><strong>D protection:</strong> uphold standing and respect precisely where no solution exists</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These criteria do not “solve” tragedy; they prevent <strong>moral betrayal</strong> of persons and roles.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>14) Red-Flag Pattern Set (Immediate Miscode Indicators)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>“There must have been a way with no harm.” (Λ denial)</li>
			<li>“If you were competent, this wouldn’t have happened.” (Θ + Ω moralization)</li>
			<li>“Stop making it complicated.” (Χ attacked)</li>
			<li>“Explaining constraints is just excuses.” (Χ collapse)</li>
			<li>“We need someone accountable <em>right now</em>.” (Θ compresses reversibility)</li>
			<li>“Knowing this now proves you should have known then.” (Φ weaponized)</li>
			<li>“If we punish someone, we can move on.” (Ψ displaced into scapegoat)</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h2>15) Output You <em>May</em> Produce (PMS-Compatible)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>structural mapping of tragic constraints without prescribing “the right choice”</li>
			<li>separation of <strong>harm</strong> from <strong>culpability</strong> under Χ</li>
			<li>capacity-bounded attribution: who could influence what, when</li>
			<li>remainder-harm articulation: what cannot be prevented (Λ)</li>
			<li>post-event reframing protocol: how to prevent Φ from turning into certainty</li>
			<li>dignity audit: where D is threatened by blame narratives</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>You may not produce (PMS-invalid):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>“who is guilty” determinations</li>
			<li>moral ranking of actors under tragic remainder</li>
			<li>prescriptions framed as moral imperatives</li>
			<li>scapegoat optimization (“who to blame to restore trust”)</li>
			<li>retroactive responsibility inflation beyond capacity/frames</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h2>16) Minimal “MAP” Walkthrough (5 Questions)</h2>
			<ol>
			<li><strong>□ Frame:</strong> Which competing frames were active, and which became totalized after the fact?</li>
			<li><strong>Λ Non-event:</strong> What “clean outcome” never existed structurally?</li>
			<li><strong>Ω Asymmetry:</strong> Where were real capacity gradients—and where were omnipotence expectations projected?</li>
			<li><strong>Χ Distance:</strong> Where did outrage attempt to collapse distance into certainty and blame?</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ Self-binding:</strong> Is the system binding itself to learning/restraint—or binding itself to scapegoating?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If MAP answers drift toward “it was avoidable, therefore guilt,” the blame spiral is active.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>17) PMS Assistant Test Vectors (Promptable)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>“Model a tragic scene where Λ is irreducible and Θ makes all exits painful. Show the miscode into avoidable failure.”</li>
			<li>“Identify where Χ collapses in post-event discourse and how Φ becomes hindsight certainty.”</li>
			<li>“Differentiate capacity-bounded responsibility (R) from omnipotence expectations under Ω.”</li>
			<li>“Project the configuration onto A/C/R/E/D and locate where D is first threatened.”</li>
			<li>“Describe how Α stabilizes scapegoating as the default response to tragedy.”</li>
			</ul>
