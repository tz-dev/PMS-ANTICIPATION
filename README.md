# PMS–ANTICIPATION

**Structural Conditions, Risks, and Viability of Anticipatory Praxis**

**PMS–ANTICIPATION is a formal application of the [Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)](https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory)** — a generative operator framework (Δ–Ψ) for modelling praxis, asymmetry, temporality, and self-binding.  

While PMS provides the **canonical operator grammar** for analysing action and non-action, PMS–ANTICIPATION reconstructs a widely misunderstood practical posture: **anticipation**.

Building explicitly on the PMS as its structural foundation, this project does **not modify or extend the PMS operator set**, but uses it **strictly as specified** to show:  

* why anticipation is **not** prediction, control, intelligence, or action advantage,
* how anticipation is a **present structural stance** toward possible events and **non-events (Λ)**,
* and why the core test of anticipation is **viability under non-occurrence** and **non-coercion under asymmetry (Ω)**.

PMS–ANTICIPATION treats “the future” not as a truth-object, but as a structural field where:

* **Non-event (Λ)** remains active (absence, delay, omission),
* **Temporality (Θ)** makes consequences irreversible,
* **Distance (Χ)** must prevent closure and coercive enactment,
* **Integration (Σ)** stabilizes coherence without totalization,
* **Self-binding (Ψ)** binds the anticipator (not others) to restraint and consequence-handling.

In this sense, PMS–ANTICIPATION should be read as:

* **conceptually dependent on PMS**,
* **formally consistent with the PMS operator grammar**, and
* **focused on the structural discipline of anticipation under uncertainty**.

## What PMS–ANTICIPATION Is

PMS–ANTICIPATION is:

* A **structural theory of anticipation** (not a forecasting method)
* A **PMS-conform application** of the operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)
* A framework for analysing:
  * **non-event handling (Λ)** under irreversibility (Θ)
  * **asymmetry risks (Ω)** and coercion drift
  * the stabilizing roles of **distance (Χ)**, **integration (Σ)**, and **self-binding (Ψ)**
* A viability model that evaluates anticipation by:
  * **structural stability**
  * **restraint**
  * **attributable consequence-handling**
  * rather than predictive “hit/miss”

**Guiding formula:**

> **Non-prognostic in truth /  
> Criterial in restraint /  
> Responsibility-bearing in structure**

---

## What PMS–ANTICIPATION Is *Not*

PMS–ANTICIPATION is not:

* A prediction or forecasting framework
* A strategy handbook or optimization guide
* A “be early / be right” advantage model
* A psychological theory of cognition, traits, or intelligence
* A clinical or diagnostic tool
* A framework for person-evaluation, ranking, or moral sanctioning

Anticipation is treated as a **praxeological configuration** —  
not as a competence, virtue, or mental ability.

---

## Core Thesis

PMS–ANTICIPATION argues that:

* **Anticipation is not a truth-claim about the future.**
* Anticipation is a **present structural stance** that carries **openness (Λ)** under **irreversibility (Θ)** and **asymmetry (Ω)**.
* Anticipatory maturity is measured not by being right, but by remaining:
  * **viable under non-occurrence (Λ)**
  * **non-coercive under asymmetry (Ω)**
  * **distance-preserving (Χ)**
  * **self-binding rather than externalizing (Ψ)**

> Anticipation does not authorize action —  
> it deepens responsibility for restraint.

---

## Relation to PMS

PMS–ANTICIPATION is built directly on the **canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)** as defined in [`PMS.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory/refs/heads/main/model/PMS.yaml) (schema_version: `PMS_1.1`).  

* No new operators are introduced
* No operator is redefined
* All dependency rules are respected
* Anticipation is analysed strictly as **operator configuration** and **derived-axis viability**

Where PMS provides the **structural grammar of praxis**,  
PMS–ANTICIPATION shows what follows when that grammar is applied to:

* uncertainty without closure,
* non-events and omission,
* asymmetric exposure and capacity gradients,
* irreversibility and trajectory formation,
* and post-confirmation power drift.

## Structural Contributions

### 1. Anticipation Reframed (Non-Prognostic)
Anticipation is reconstructed as a structural stance, not as epistemic privilege:

* not “knowing the future”
* not “controlling outcomes”
* not “legitimizing early intervention”

### 2. Non-Event Discipline (Λ as Core Object)
The decisive structural object of anticipation is often not an event but a **non-event**:

* delay
* absence
* omission
* failure-to-occur

Anticipation remains valid only if **Λ stays open**.

### 3. Viability Criteria without Predictive Success
Anticipatory viability is defined by structural conditions:

* **Coherence (C)** under non-occurrence (Λ)
* **Responsibility (R)** under asymmetry (Ω)
* sustained **distance (Χ)** across temporality (Θ)

### 4. The Trade-Off: Effectiveness vs Stability
PMS–ANTICIPATION formalizes a structural trade-off:

* effectiveness increases as **Ψ approaches E**
* stability increases as **Χ precedes E**

These are **incompatible optimizations**, not informational deficits.

### 5. Post-Confirmation Discipline
Confirmation is treated not as success, but as a **transition risk**:

* Λ partially collapses
* Θ pressure compresses
* Ω inflates as “epistemic authority”

Maturity is measured by restoring **Χ** and renewing **Ψ**, not accelerating **E**.

## Final Note

PMS–ANTICIPATION does not tell you what will happen.

It explains how anticipation becomes structurally valid only when it:

* carries non-closure (Λ),
* respects irreversibility (Θ),
* disciplines asymmetry (Ω),
* preserves distance (Χ),
* and binds the anticipator (Ψ) — not the world.

> Anticipation is not about being early —  
> it is about being bound before acting.
