# PMS–ANTICIPATION

## Structural Conditions, Risks, and Viability of Anticipatory Praxis (Δ–Ψ)

**PMS–ANTICIPATION is a formal application of the [Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)](https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory)** — a generative operator framework (Δ–Ψ) for modelling praxis, asymmetry, temporality, and self-binding.

While PMS provides the **canonical operator grammar** for analysing action and non-action, PMS–ANTICIPATION reconstructs a widely misunderstood practical posture: **anticipation**.

Building explicitly on PMS as its structural foundation, this project does **not modify or extend the PMS operator set**, but uses it **strictly as specified** to show:

* why anticipation is **not** prediction, intelligence, control, or action advantage,
* how anticipation is a **present structural stance** toward possible events and **non-events (Λ)**,
* how **asymmetry (Ω)** and **temporality (Θ)** transform anticipation into a high-risk praxis form,
* why the decisive test of anticipation is **viability under non-occurrence** and **non-coercion under asymmetry**,
* and why anticipatory maturity is measured by **restraint, distance (Χ), and self-binding (Ψ)** rather than correctness.

PMS–ANTICIPATION treats “the future” not as a truth-object, but as a structural field in which:

* **Non-event (Λ)** remains active (absence, delay, omission),
* **Temporality (Θ)** renders consequences irreversible,
* **Distance (Χ)** prevents premature closure and coercive enactment,
* **Integration (Σ)** stabilizes coherence without totalization,
* **Self-binding (Ψ)** binds the anticipator — not others — to restraint and consequence-handling.

In this sense, PMS–ANTICIPATION should be read as:

* **conceptually dependent on PMS**,
* **formally consistent with the PMS operator grammar**, and
* **focused on the structural discipline of anticipation under uncertainty**.

## What PMS–ANTICIPATION Is

PMS–ANTICIPATION is:

* A **structural theory of anticipation** (not a forecasting method)
* A **PMS_1.1–conform application profile** of the operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)
* A framework for analysing:
  * **non-event handling (Λ)** under irreversibility (Θ)
  * **asymmetry risks (Ω)** and coercion drift
  * the stabilizing roles of **distance (Χ)**, **integration (Σ)**, and **self-binding (Ψ)**
* A viability model that evaluates anticipation by:
  * **structural stability**
  * **restraint**
  * **attributable consequence-handling**
  * rather than predictive “hit/miss” success

**Guiding formula:**

> **Non-prognostic in truth /  
> Criterial in restraint /  
> Responsibility-bearing in structure**

---

## What PMS–ANTICIPATION Is *Not*

PMS–ANTICIPATION is not:

* A prediction or forecasting framework
* A strategy handbook or optimization guide
* A “be early / be right” advantage model
* A psychological theory of cognition, traits, or intelligence
* A clinical or diagnostic tool
* A framework for person-evaluation, ranking, or moral sanctioning

Anticipation is treated as a **praxeological configuration** —  
not as a competence, virtue, or mental ability.

---

## Intended Use

PMS–ANTICIPATION is intended for:

* Structural theorists analysing uncertainty, omission, and irreversibility
* Governance, policy, and institutional analysis under asymmetry
* AI architecture and AI safety (structural, non-psychological)
* Comparative analysis of praxeological configurations (not persons)

It is **not** intended for action directives, optimization advice, personal guidance, or moral enforcement.

Any application presupposes the **PMS entry condition**:

**Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice)**

---

## Core Thesis

PMS–ANTICIPATION argues that:

* **Anticipation is not a truth-claim about the future.**
* Anticipation is a **present structural stance** that carries **openness (Λ)** under **irreversibility (Θ)** and **asymmetry (Ω)**.
* Anticipatory maturity is measured not by being right, but by remaining:
  * **viable under non-occurrence (Λ)**,
  * **non-coercive under asymmetry (Ω)**,
  * **distance-preserving (Χ)**,
  * **self-binding rather than externalizing (Ψ)**.

> Anticipation does not authorize action —  
> it deepens responsibility for restraint.

---

## Relation to PMS

PMS–ANTICIPATION is built directly on the **canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)** as defined in  
[`PMS.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory/refs/heads/main/model/PMS.yaml)  
(schema_version: `PMS_1.1`).

* No new operators are introduced
* No operator is redefined
* All dependency rules are respected
* All applications remain **scene-bound, reversible, and non-diagnostic**

Where PMS provides the **grammar of praxis**,  
PMS–ANTICIPATION specifies how that grammar behaves when applied to:

* uncertainty without closure,
* non-events and omission,
* asymmetric exposure and capacity gradients,
* irreversibility and trajectory formation,
* and post-confirmation power drift.

## What PMS.yaml + PMS-ANTICIPATION.yaml Provide (That PMS Alone Does Not)

**PMS.yaml** supplies the canonical operator system (Δ–Ψ), dependency hygiene, layers, and derived axes.

**PMS-ANTICIPATION.yaml** adds a **domain-specific application profile** for anticipation that makes the following **explicitly recordable and comparable**:

### 1) Structural thresholds for anticipation

* **Minimal anticipation** = Δ + □ + Λ + Θ + Χ  
* **Viable anticipation** = full Δ–Ψ chain (disciplining ∇, integrating Σ, binding Ψ)

These are not proofs or mandates, but **structural viability markers**.

### 2) Viability criteria independent of being right

Anticipation is evaluated by:

* carrying Λ rather than resolving it,
* sustaining Χ under Θ-pressure,
* binding Ψ inward (self), not outward (others),
* preserving D (dignity-in-practice) under Ω.

### 3) Contrast frames: anticipation vs prognosis

PMS–ANTICIPATION explicitly separates:

* **anticipation** (present stance, openness retained)
* from **prognosis** (future-truth claims that risk authority and closure)

Prognoses may inform anticipation, but must not supply authorization.

### 4) Risk and failure modes (structural, not moral)

Including:

* preemptive authoritarianism (Ω inflation),
* probability-induced action compulsion,
* moralization of uncertainty,
* preventive escalation,
* post-confirmation dominance drift.

### 5) Post-confirmation discipline

Being right is treated as a **second-order risk**:

* Λ partially collapses,
* Θ compresses decision windows,
* Ω inflates as epistemic authority.

Maturity requires restoring **Χ** and renewing **Ψ**, not accelerating **E**.

### 6) Minimal Application Protocol (MAP)

A strict, scene-bound protocol that prevents anticipation from mutating into coercion.

## Final Note

PMS–ANTICIPATION does not tell you what will happen.

It explains why anticipation becomes structurally valid only when it:

* carries non-closure (Λ),
* respects irreversibility (Θ),
* disciplines asymmetry (Ω),
* preserves distance (Χ),
* and binds the anticipator (Ψ) — not the world.

> **Anticipation is not about being early —
> it is about being bound before acting.**
