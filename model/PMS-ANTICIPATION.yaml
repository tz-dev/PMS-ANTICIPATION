#  PMS-ANTICIPATION — PAPER-SPECIFIC APPLICATION SCHEMA (OVERLAY)
#
#  Repository:
#    https://github.com/tz-dev/PMS-ANTICIPATION
#
#  File:
#    PMS-ANTICIPATION.yaml
#
#  Schema Version:
#    PMS-ANTICIPATION_1.0
#
#  Last Updated:
#    2026-01-08
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  PURPOSE AND STATUS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This document defines a paper-specific APPLICATION SCHEMA for the
#  Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS). It formalizes the theoretical arguments
#  of the accompanying paper
#
#    “PMS-ANTICIPATION — [paper title placeholder if not fixed]:
#     A Praxeological Grammar of Anticipation (Δ–Ψ)”
#
#  by expressing them in a machine-readable, structurally constrained form.
#
#  The schema is an OVERLAY, not a fork or extension of PMS. Its function is to
#  make the ANTICIPATION lens formally legible while remaining strictly
#  subordinate to the canonical PMS specification.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  RELATIONSHIP TO PMS (NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  - This schema DEPENDS on the canonical PMS base specification
#    (schema_version: PMS_1.1).
#
#  - It does NOT redefine, replace, reinterpret, or extend the eleven PMS
#    meta-axioms (Δ–Ψ).
#
#  - It does NOT introduce new operators, meta-axioms, or dependency relations.
#
#  - It does NOT modify canonical operator order, dependency hygiene, or
#    derived axes (A, C, R, E, D).
#
#  - All references to operators (Δ–Ψ) retain their meanings exactly as defined
#    in PMS.yaml.
#
#  - Any apparent deviations (e.g. “reduced signatures”, “protocols”,
#    “comparison profiles”, “drift markers”) are overlay-level constructs only
#    and MUST NOT be read as changes to PMS operator logic.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  SCOPE OF THE OVERLAY
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This application schema introduces ONLY overlay-level constructs, including:
#
#    - reduced operator signatures (shorthand expressions for analysis),
#    - viability criteria and invalidity markers (structural, not moral),
#    - contrast frames (anticipation vs prognosis),
#    - drift markers and misuse corridors (configuration markers),
#    - post-confirmation discipline (restoring Χ after being right),
#    - minimal scene-bound application protocols,
#    - example-suite schemas (scene-bound, non-instructional).
#
#  These constructs:
#    - amplify or organize existing PMS operators,
#    - never replace generativity with explanation,
#    - never convert probability into authorization (especially under Ω and Θ),
#    - never inject norms, duties, or prescriptive action mandates,
#    - remain descriptive, non-diagnostic, and non-prescriptive.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  VALIDITY GATE — PMS ENTRY CONDITION (APPLICATION-ONLY)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Any USE of this schema as a PMS APPLICATION presupposes acceptance of the
#  canonical PMS entry condition:
#
#    - Χ (Distance):
#        a maintained meta-position and stop-capability; no fusion into verdict,
#        urgency, ideology, or role authority.
#
#    - Reversibility:
#        all readings are scene-bound, revisable, and configuration-specific;
#        no global person labels or irreversible interpretive claims.
#
#    - D (Dignity-in-Practice):
#        no shaming, ranking, humiliation, or ontological person evaluation;
#        critique is restricted to structural handling of risk, exposure,
#        capacity, and restraint under Ω and Θ.
#
#  This gate constrains APPLICATION only.
#  PMS itself may be criticized, rejected, or ignored without satisfying it.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  SELF-BINDING AND MODEL HYGIENE (CLARIFICATION)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  In line with PMS.yaml, any application that suspends Distance (Χ),
#  Dignity-in-Practice (D), or Self-Binding discipline (Ψ) in order to enforce
#  clarity, certainty, authority, or action is formally INVALID as PMS
#  application—even if PMS terminology is retained.
#
#  PMS-ANTICIPATION therefore treats all analyses as:
#    - scene-bound,
#    - structurally revisable,
#    - non-metaphysical,
#    - non-psychological,
#    - non-moralizing.
#
#  Anticipation is treated as a present stance that carries Λ within □ under Θ,
#  not as a forecast that closes Λ into future truth.

    APPLICATION PROFILE for PMS that formalizes ANTICIPATION as a structurally

    Provides reduced signatures, validity criteria, contrast frames to prognosis,

  name: "Anticipation"
  definition: >
    Anticipation is the structurally disciplined handling of possible future
    events and non-events under asymmetry (Ω), without closure claims.
  non_negotiable_constraints:
    - id: "discipline"
      meaning: >
        Anticipation is regulated by Χ/Σ/Ψ: impulses, uncertainties, and frames
        are coordinated without totalization or authority claims.
    - id: "non_event_centrality"
      meaning: >
        Anticipation structurally carries Λ (Non-Event) inside □ (Frame) rather
        than converting absence into settled future truth.
    - id: "no_closure_claims"
      meaning: >
        Anticipation does not translate the possible into certainty, nor the

    These are paper-specific roles (overlay semantics), not operator redefinitions.
  roles:
    "Δ":
      anticipation_role: "Marks a bounded anticipatory object without valuation or truth-claim."
    "∇":
      anticipation_role: "Introduces directional tension; also the closure-drive that must be regulated downstream."
    "□":
      anticipation_role: "Binds anticipation to a concrete role-space and scope; prevents global projection."
    "Λ":
      anticipation_role: "Core discipline: carries meaningful absence ('may not happen') as structurally decisive."
    "Α":
      anticipation_role: "Encodes repetition/path-dependence; stabilizes (or hardens) anticipatory patterns over time."
    "Ω":
      anticipation_role: "Makes restraint consequential: uneven exposure/capacity creates risk of dominance."
    "Θ":
      anticipation_role: "Introduces irreversibility: accumulating costs, closing windows, durable consequences."
    "Φ":
      anticipation_role: "Allows adaptation to new information without retroactive innocence or narrative collapse."
    "Χ":
      anticipation_role: "Stop-capability: prevents closure, coercion, and premature enactment under pressure."
    "Σ":
      anticipation_role: "Coordinates multiple signals/pressures while keeping Λ open (integration without totalization)."
    "Ψ":
      anticipation_role: "Stabilizing fixpoint: binds the anticipator to restraint/consequence-handling (not others)."
