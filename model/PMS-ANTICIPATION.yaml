#  Version:        PMS-ANTICIPATION_1.0 (draft)
#  Last Updated:   2026-01-08
#
#  Summary:
#    This document defines a paper-specific APPLICATION PROFILE for the
#    Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS). It provides a structural overlay
#    for the lens of ANTICIPATION, expressed strictly in the canonical PMS
#    operator grammar (Δ–Ψ).
#
#  Relationship to PMS (non-negotiable):
#    - Depends on the canonical PMS base specification (schema_version: PMS_1.1).
#    - Does NOT redefine Δ–Ψ, does NOT add new meta-axioms, and does NOT
#      modify operator dependencies or derived axes.
#    - Introduces ONLY overlay-level constructs: reduced signatures,
#      drift markers, comparison profiles, protocols, and example schemas.
#
#  Validity Gate (PMS entry condition — application-only):
#    Any USE of this profile as PMS-application presupposes:
#      - Χ (distance),
#      - reversibility (scene-bound, revisable readings),
#      - D (dignity-in-practice; no shaming/ranking; structure-only critique).
#    This gate constrains application, not critique or rejection.

  description: >
    APPLICATION PROFILE for PMS that formalizes ANTICIPATION as a structurally
    disciplined present stance under Λ (Non-Event) and Θ (Temporality) in the
    presence of Ω (Asymmetry), sustained by Χ (Distance), Σ (Integration), and
    Ψ (Self-Binding) — without redefining PMS operators or altering dependencies.
    Provides reduced signatures, validity criteria, contrast frames to prognosis,
    drift markers, post-confirmation discipline, and a minimal application protocol.

  note: >
    This gate constrains PMS-application only (not critique or rejection).
  requires:
    - id: "Χ"
      name: "Distance"
      meaning: "meta-position / stop-capability; no fusion into verdict"
    - id: "reversibility"
      meaning: "scene-bound, revisable readings; no global person labels"
    - id: "D"

    Any use of Χ in reduced signatures is shorthand only; in PMS, Χ depends on

overlays: {}

paper_lens:
  name: "Anticipation"
  definition: >
    Anticipation is the structurally disciplined handling of possible future
    events and non-events under asymmetry (Ω), without closure claims.
  non_negotiable_constraints:
    - id: "discipline"
      meaning: >
        Anticipation is regulated by Χ/Σ/Ψ: impulses, uncertainties, and frames
        are coordinated without totalization or authority claims.
    - id: "non_event_centrality"
      meaning: >
        Anticipation structurally carries Λ (Non-Event) inside □ (Frame) rather
        than converting absence into settled future truth.
    - id: "no_closure_claims"
      meaning: >
        Anticipation does not translate the possible into certainty, nor the
        probable into authorization (especially under Ω and Θ).

lens_operator_roles:
  note: >
    These are paper-specific roles (overlay semantics), not operator redefinitions.
  roles:
    "Δ":
      anticipation_role: "Marks a bounded anticipatory object without valuation or truth-claim."
    "∇":
      anticipation_role: "Introduces directional tension; also the closure-drive that must be regulated downstream."
    "□":
      anticipation_role: "Binds anticipation to a concrete role-space and scope; prevents global projection."
    "Λ":
      anticipation_role: "Core discipline: carries meaningful absence ('may not happen') as structurally decisive."
    "Α":
      anticipation_role: "Encodes repetition/path-dependence; stabilizes (or hardens) anticipatory patterns over time."
    "Ω":
      anticipation_role: "Makes restraint consequential: uneven exposure/capacity creates risk of dominance."
    "Θ":
      anticipation_role: "Introduces irreversibility: accumulating costs, closing windows, durable consequences."
    "Φ":
      anticipation_role: "Allows adaptation to new information without retroactive innocence or narrative collapse."
    "Χ":
      anticipation_role: "Stop-capability: prevents closure, coercion, and premature enactment under pressure."
    "Σ":
      anticipation_role: "Coordinates multiple signals/pressures while keeping Λ open (integration without totalization)."
    "Ψ":
      anticipation_role: "Stabilizing fixpoint: binds the anticipator to restraint/consequence-handling (not others)."

derived_axes_reference:
  note: "Axes are canonical PMS derived structures; this profile only states relevance under the anticipation lens."
  relevance:
    A:
      name: "Awareness"
      note: "Sustains framed differentiation over time without escalating into certainty."
    C:
      name: "Coherence"
      note: "Maintains anticipatory narratives stable under non-occurrence and delay."
    R:
      name: "Responsibility"
      note: "Attaches where capacity exists; binds through Ψ under Ω and Θ, not through being 'right'."
    E:
      name: "Action"
      note: "May occur downstream, but never follows from anticipation without Χ + D + reversibility."
    D:
      name: "Dignity-in-practice"
      note: "Non-coercive handling of Ω; tested especially after confirmation."

reduced_signatures:
  ANT_min:
    label: "Minimal anticipatory stance (reduced signature)"
    operators: ["Δ", "□", "Λ", "Θ", "Χ"]
    note: >
      Minimal anticipation is present when a bounded possibility (Δ in □) remains
      structurally open (Λ) under irreversibility (Θ) with sustained restraint (Χ).
      This chain is explicitly not action-authorizing.
  ANT_viable_full:
    label: "Viable anticipatory configuration (full PMS chain)"
    operators: ["Δ", "∇", "□", "Λ", "Α", "Ω", "Θ", "Φ", "Χ", "Σ", "Ψ"]
    note: >
      Mature anticipation disciplines impulse (∇), carries openness (Λ), recognizes
      pattern stabilization (Α), handles asymmetry (Ω) across time (Θ), adapts (Φ),
      preserves distance (Χ), integrates without closure (Σ), and binds the
      anticipator (Ψ).
  ANT_to_planning_constraint:

    is_operator: false
    requires: ["Χ", "D", "reversibility"]

criteria:

    - id: "Λ_carried"
      meaning: "Λ is carried, not resolved; openness remains structurally active."

    - id: "Χ_active"
      meaning: "Χ remains active even under high probability; 'likely' does not become 'authorized'."
    - id: "Ψ_binds_self"

  viability_definition:
    label: "Viability (PMS definition)"
    definition: >
      An anticipatory configuration is viable if it remains coherent (C) under Λ
      and responsibility-bearing (R) under Ω and Θ, without collapsing Χ.

      This externalizes Ψ and collapses Χ under Ω/Θ pressure, violating the PMS

    pms_conclusion: >
      Anticipation is structurally valid only when it increases the anticipator’s
      obligation to restraint and consequence-handling — not when it supplies authority.

      - "Renew contingency acknowledgment under Θ."
      - "Refuse generalization from single confirmations into enduring Ω dominance."

structural_potentials_and_costs:
  possible_advantages:
    - "Reduced surprise amplitude (carrying Λ under Θ softens discontinuities)."
    - "Higher crisis resilience (Χ + Σ prevent reactive actionism collapse)."
    - "Early self-binding (Ψ stabilizes responsibility independent of outcomes)."
    - "Escalation dampening (disciplined Ω handling prevents power inflation)."
    - "Protection of vulnerable positions (D preserved especially after confirmation)."
  possible_disadvantages:
    - "Increased cognitive/structural load (carrying Λ under Θ is demanding)."
    - "Risk of self-overestimation (confirmation hardens Α and misplaces Ψ)."
    - "Delayed action (strong Χ/Σ can overshoot closing Θ-windows)."
    - "Misuse as power instrument (stance weaponized; erodes D)."
    - "Misinterpretation as 'knowing better' (others project dominance onto restraint)."

    Anticipation fails structurally not by being wrong, but by betraying restraint
    when rightness tempts authority.
